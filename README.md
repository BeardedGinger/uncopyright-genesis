Uncopyright Genesis
===================

Allows you to quickly add an "Uncopyright" footer to your Genesis sites. Uncopyright information displays as a modal window when someone clicks the link in the footer. [See demo in footer of my personal blog](http://joshmallard.com)

Customize
=========

Fork and update with your own preferred footer content and Uncopyright text if you like.
